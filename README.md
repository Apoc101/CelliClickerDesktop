# CelliClickerDesktop
Celli Clicker, an originally mobile clicker game, now ported on desktop.

Still not finished:
trying to figure out serialization to JSON (for saving/reading data) and background processes, so if you have any tips send em here: gabriel@gabmort.me

Notice any bugs? Feel free to open an issue!
